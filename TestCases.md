 # UNIT TEST 1

 A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

# Expectations

the function multiplication will return the product of two numbers
the functions takes 2 arguments 
the 2 arguments are 2 numbers
the 2 arguments are 2 negative numbers
the 2 areguments are 1 negative and 1 positive number
the 2 arguments are 1 number and 0
we would expect multiplication(2, 3) will return 6
we would expect multiplication(-2, -3) will return 6
we would expect multiplication(2, -3) will return -6
we would expect multiplication(2, 0) will return 0

# Test Specs
1. Expect multiplication(2, 3) to return 6
2. Expect multiplication(2) to return 0 or error 
3. Expect mutliplication(2,'string') to return 0 or error
4. Expect multiplication('string', 'string') to return 0 or error
5. Expect muliplication() to return 0 or error
6. Exxpect multiplication (4,-3) to return -12
7. Expect mutliplication of (-4, -3) to return 12
8. Expect multiplication of (4, 0) to retrun 0


# Unit Test 2
# A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
Example: concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])
...should result in [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]

# Expectattion

1. the function concatOdds will concatenate the input arrays and write the resultant array in ascending order.
2. The function should only return odd numbers
3. The function should return the array in ascending order
4. The function takes 2 arguments
5. The 2 arguments are 2 arrays with integers
